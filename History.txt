== 3.1.4 2011-10-27

*  Changed all the cap tasks to use the :resque role.
    - You now need to define the :resque role in your deploy/<environment>.rb file with the servers that will run your workers.
        role :resque, 'server1', 'server2'
      The cap tasks used to run the :app role, but this has been changed to allow you to better refine your servers.  You may not run
      the resque workers on all, or even any of your :app servers.
