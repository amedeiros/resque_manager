*  Fix a typo

== 3.1.1 2011-10-13

*  Modified the restart_workers and quit_workers cap tasks to no longer use the , :only => {:resque_restart => true} flag.
    -   These tasks now execute the rake tasks on all servers in the farm
*  Modified the restart_workers and quit_workers rake tasks to not execute separate cap tasks for each worker.
    -   Task now iterates through the workers and restarts the ones on the box the rake task is executing on.

*  Added Resque Cleaner to manage the failed queue.  Removed the Failed tab.

== 3.0.0 2011-09-16

*  converted plugging to a gem/engine for Rails 3
