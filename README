ResqueUi
========

Resque UI is a Rails plugin port of the Sinatra app that is included in Chris Wanstrath's resque gem.  We love the gem and love the UI,
but just didn't want to add Sinatra to our stack.


Installation
=======

script/plugin install git://github.com/kevintyll/resque_ui.git

Once installed, you now have a resque controller, so you can get to the ui with:  http://your_domain/resque.
