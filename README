ResqueUi
========

Resque UI is a Rails plugin port of the Sinatra app that is included in Chris Wanstrath's resque gem.  We love the gem and love the UI,
but just didn't want to add Sinatra to our stack.


Installation
=======

script/plugin install git://github.com/kevintyll/resque_ui.git

Once installed, you now have a resque controller, so you can get to the ui with:  http://your_domain/resque.

Dependencies
=======

This plugin requires the resque gem

sudo gem install resque

Additions
=======

The displaying of times is fixed.  Some browsers displayed "Nan days ago" for all process times in the original Sinatra app.

------------------------------

Added the ability to display process status in the worker "Processing" column on the workers and working pages.
To do this, in the class that you have enqueued, set the $0
variable with status messages.  The string must start with "resque:"
ex.  Inside a loop that is processing a .csv file, I have:

if row_count % 100 == 0
    $0 = "resque: #{self.filename} - Upload - #{row_count} rows processed"
end

The "#{self.filename} - Upload - #{row_count} rows processed" shows up in the "Processing" column on the workers and working pages.

NOTE:  This feature currently only works in dev.  To to refactor to make it work in other environments.

------------------------------

Added the ability to restart failed jobs, and clear individual failed jobs from the list

------------------------------

Added the ability to stop, start, and restart workers from the workers page.  This requires capistrano, and capistrano-ext to be installed.
The controller calls cap tasks to manage the workers.  To include the recipes in you application, add this line to your deploy.rb file:
      require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../vendor/plugins/resque_ui/lib/resque_ui/cap_recipes'

You will also need to make sure you have your rake path set in the deploy.rb file.
               ex.  set :rake, "/opt/ruby-enterprise-1.8.6-20090421/bin/rake"

The cap tasks included are:
 cap resque:work          # start a resque worker.
 cap resque:workers       # start multiple resque workers.
 cap resque:quit_worker   # Gracefully kill a worker.  If the worker is working, it will finish before shutting down.
